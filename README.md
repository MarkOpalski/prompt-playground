## 🚀 Quick Start

Each project includes its own setup instructions and documentation. Navigate to any project folder to get started.

## 🛠 Development Approach

**AI Collaboration:**

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - Primary code generation
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) - Problem solving and architecture guidance
- Community prompts from [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)

**My Role:**

- Prompt engineering and refinement
- Project curation and organization
- Environment setup and deployment
- Documentation and testing
- GitHub Pages hosting

## 📋 Project Template

Each project follows a consistent structure:

```
