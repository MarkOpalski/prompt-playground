## 🎯 About This Project

This repository showcases various experiments created through AI collaboration, demonstrating the power of prompt engineering and AI-assisted development. Each project represents a different exploration of creative coding, data visualization, web applications, and interactive tools.

**🆕 New Feature**: Each project now includes a "View Prompt" button that displays the original AI prompt used to create it, providing complete transparency in the AI-assisted development process.

## 📁 Project Categories

### 📊 Visualizations

- [Water Cycle Graph](./projects/visualizations/water-cycle-graph/) - Interactive water cycle visualization using Python and Graphviz
  - **Original Prompt Source**: Root page of [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)

### 🌐 Web Applications

- [Todo App](./projects/web-apps/todo-app/) - Feature-rich task management application

## ✨ Interactive Features

### 📝 Prompt Display Modals

Each project on the live demo site includes a "View Prompt" button that opens a modal displaying:

- **Original AI Prompt**: The exact prompt used to generate the project
- **Source Attribution**: Links to [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) by [@f](https://github.com/f)
- **Copy Functionality**: One-click copying of prompts for reuse
- **Metadata**: Date, source platform, and prompt location information

This transparency allows visitors to understand the AI collaboration process and reuse successful prompts for their own projects.

## 🛠 Development Approach

**AI Collaboration:**

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - Primary code generation
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) - Problem solving and architecture guidance
- Community prompts from [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) by [@f](https://github.com/f)

**My Role:**

- Prompt engineering and refinement
- Project curation and organization
- Environment setup and deployment
- Documentation and testing
- GitHub Pages hosting

## 📋 Project Template

Each project follows a consistent structure:

```
project-name/
├── README.md          # Project-specific documentation
├── requirements.txt   # Dependencies (if applicable)
├── src/              # Source code
